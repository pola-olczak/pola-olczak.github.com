# Intro

I am an enthusiastic  Field Applications Scientist at [Covaris](https://www.covaris.com/), passionate about educating customers and building customer relations. I am experienced in delivering oral presentations in person and virtually. I am a skilled written communicator with a track record of publications, scientific posters and communication through emails, virtual meetings and Salesforce.

I am a curious scientist with a Ph.D degree in Pathobiology from the [Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/som). During my doctoral studies, I worked on Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) vaccine development under Dr. Richard Roden. I hold a Master's (Sc.M) in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology from the Johns Hopkins, Bloomberg School of Public Health. I obtained my Bachelors degree in Chemistry from Morgan State University. While I have always had a proclivity toward public health, I cut my teeth in HPV vaccine development while working for [PathoVax](https://www.pathovax.com/).


# My Passions

I am passionate about the pursuit of global public health in one form or another. More recently, issues surrounding womenâ€™s health specifically drive my creativity and inspire me to pursue novel scientific discovery. The potential of 
work conducted by this community to reach millions of people, is something that gives me great sense of purpose.


# My Hobbies

- I was an NCAA Division 1 tennis player as an undergraduate, and still love playing tennis.
- I enjoy traveling, sightseeing, and all nature has to offer.
- In a past life I was an avid skier, but recently have begun to prefer snowboarding.

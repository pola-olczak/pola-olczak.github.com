# Intro

I am a PhD candidate in Pathobiology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine working on 
HPV vaccine development. I am team player who understand team cohesion is pivotal to success.


My scientific and professional interest and experience is broad and ranges from epidemiology, to drug development for
cancer treatment, to reproductive health, to microbiology and immunology.


Everyday I work to learn or improve upon my knowledge, a skill or a productivity-oriented habit.
Doing so in a quantifiable manner ensures that I continue to hone my skills as a professional.


# My Passions

I am passionate about the pursuit of global public health in one form or another. More recently, issues surrounding womenâ€™s health specifically drive my creativity and inspire me to pursue novel scientific discovery. The potential of 
work conducted by this community to reach millions of people, is something that gives me great sense of purpose.
